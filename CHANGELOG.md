## 0.2.0 ‚Äî 2025-08-22

Highlights

- Ghost Operative: Phase Cloak now lasts 5s and has a 15s cooldown. Grants strong fade, damage immunity, and a speed boost while active.
- Enemy AI: During cloak, enemies pursue the player‚Äôs locked position taken at cloak start until cloak ends.
- HUD: Ghost now has two class bars (Sniper charge and Cloak status) with clear READY/ACTIVE/seconds readouts.
- Character Select: Theme aligned to the main menu (cyan/teal). Weapon info made useful with actionable tips and improved lore readability.

Added

- Weapon tips: usageTips added for key weapons; UI shows them, with a smart fallback tip generator when tips are absent.
- Cloak events: ghostCloakStart/ghostCloakEnd events dispatched for systems to react (AI follows locked position).

Changed

- Ghost Cloak: duration +2s (total 5s), cooldown lowered to 15s; strong visual fade while cloaked.
- Character Select styling: unified palette, improved hover/active states, and better lore text contrast.

Fixed

- Data Sorcerer special ability description corrected to match Sigil mechanics.

Performance

- EnemyManager micro-optimizations:
  - Cache performance.now() per frame.
  - Hoist chase speed cap and roomManager lookups out of inner loops.
  - Lighter math in the gem update loop (precomputed radii/distances).
- Knockback logic remains radial and capped to prevent runaway acceleration.

Known issues

- Font asset warnings: Orbitron font paths may show ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt resolve at build time‚Äù during Vite build; they resolve at runtime. Consider importing fonts through the Vite assets pipeline to silence warnings.

Notes

- No data/schema migrations required. Package.json reflects version 0.2.0.
