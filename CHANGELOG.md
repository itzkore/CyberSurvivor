# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Format: Keep a Changelog style with semantic, grouped bullets. Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD.

## [Unreleased]

- feat(bio): Add Bio Engineer class ability ‚ÄúOutbreak!‚Äù ‚Äî 5s duration, 15s cooldown, forces 100% poison virality within 300px (scaled by Area). Visual green ring during active window.
- ui(hud): Add Bio Engineer Outbreak class bar (shows READY/ACTIVE/CD). üéõÔ∏è
- fix(bio): Bio Toxin puddles now scale with weapon level and Area multiplier on both impact and expiry for consistent size and lifetime.
- bal(bio): Bio Toxin projectiles no longer deal impact damage; they only spawn puddles on hit/expiry. DoT carries all damage.
- tweak(psionic): Dimmed psionic debuff (mark) glow‚Äîsmaller radius, thinner ring, and lower alpha for less visual noise.
- fix(weapon): Akimbo Deagle bullets rendered with 180¬∞ wrong sprite rotation‚Äîadded rotationOffset so art faces travel direction.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-08-27

- feat(weaver): Resonant Web implemented as persistent orbitals with radial pulses, mark refresh, and polygon web rendering. Orbs are collisionless like Quantum Halo.
- feat(weaver): Each web orb auto-casts Level 7 Psionic Wave, prefers psionic‚Äëmarked targets; normal ricochet behavior restored.
- feat(weaver): Firing is gated to nearby threats‚Äîauto-casts only occur if an enemy or boss is within 800px of the player; boss is considered in targeting and proximity.
- feat(weaver+ui): Lattice triples web auto-cast fire rate for the duration and applies a dark‚Äëpurple theme: web orbs, connecting polygon, and web‚Äëfired waves are tinted.
- ui(hud): During Lattice, Psionic Weaver‚Äôs left stats panel and class bar adopt a dark‚Äëpurple accent theme.
- fix(weaver): Prevent standard projectile spawn for Resonant Web (managed by orbit system) and ensure orbs don‚Äôt collide.
- fix(treasure): Resonant Web orbiting orbs now pass through treasures without colliding. Web pulses and web‚Äëfired waves deal damage to treasures as intended.
- fix(evolution): Corrected Psionic Wave ‚Üí Resonant Web evolution requirement to 'Area Up' (previously mislabeled 'AoE'). Evolution now offers correctly when Wave is maxed and Area Up ‚â• Lv1.
- perf: Orbit updates use per‚Äëframe guards and avoid allocations in inner loops.

## [0.2.9] - 2025-08-24

- feat(balance): Heavy Gunner Overdrive buff; Smart Rifle speed ramp made exponential.
- feat(neural): Neural Nomad threads shared per player and prioritize psionic-marked targets; multi-target linking.
- chore(weapon): Beam disabled for now due to stability/UX concerns.
- fix(boss): Boss spawn cadence tied to elapsed time to ensure second boss spawns.
- fix(visuals): Prevent background from brightening after restarts and when firing railgun; environment reset/clamps.
- fix(qol): Rerolls reset correctly at start-of-run; return-to-menu issues addressed; main menu polish.
- docs(gameplay): Documented that Beam is disabled in this release.

Older changes prior to 0.2.9 were informal and are not listed here.

## 0.2.0 ‚Äî 2025-08-22

Highlights

- Ghost Operative: Phase Cloak now lasts 5s and has a 15s cooldown. Grants strong fade, damage immunity, and a speed boost while active.
- Enemy AI: During cloak, enemies pursue the player‚Äôs locked position taken at cloak start until cloak ends.
- HUD: Ghost now has two class bars (Sniper charge and Cloak status) with clear READY/ACTIVE/seconds readouts.
- Character Select: Theme aligned to the main menu (cyan/teal). Weapon info made useful with actionable tips and improved lore readability.

Added

- Weapon tips: usageTips added for key weapons; UI shows them, with a smart fallback tip generator when tips are absent.
- Cloak events: ghostCloakStart/ghostCloakEnd events dispatched for systems to react (AI follows locked position).

Changed

- Ghost Cloak: duration +2s (total 5s), cooldown lowered to 15s; strong visual fade while cloaked.
- Character Select styling: unified palette, improved hover/active states, and better lore text contrast.

Fixed

- Data Sorcerer special ability description corrected to match Sigil mechanics.

Performance

- EnemyManager micro-optimizations:
  - Cache performance.now() per frame.
  - Hoist chase speed cap and roomManager lookups out of inner loops.
  - Lighter math in the gem update loop (precomputed radii/distances).
- Knockback logic remains radial and capped to prevent runaway acceleration.

Known issues

- Font asset warnings: Orbitron font paths may show ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt resolve at build time‚Äù during Vite build; they resolve at runtime. Consider importing fonts through the Vite assets pipeline to silence warnings.

Notes

- No data/schema migrations required. Package.json reflects version 0.2.0.
